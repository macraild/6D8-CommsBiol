Custom code used in the analysis reported in Communications Biology, 2018

This code is provided in the hope that it will help to explain our analysis 
or be of some assistance to anyone looking to implment something similar. 
In its current form, it is not self-contained and will need significant work 
to apply it to other systems, or even to reproduce the reported results. 
Accordingly it comes with no guarantees of fitness for any particular purpose,
nor any guarantees of support, but please do contact us if you are interested 
in making use of the code, and we will see if we are able to help.
